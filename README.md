# Remove dots
### [remove_dots.jsx](https://github.com/colorage/illustrator_scripts/blob/master/remove_dots.jsx)
Removes empty paths.
Sometimes with inaccurate use of "Direct selection tool" and delete button you can create empty path (dots). Clean up your .ai files with this script. 
# Remove useless points
### [remove_useless_points.jsx](https://github.com/colorage/illustrator_scripts/blob/master/remove_useless_points.jsx)
Remove point from straight sides of paths (both closed and opened).
